Site is [accessible here](https://leppekja.github.io/snap_news/), and the accompanying GitHub repository can be accessed through that site as well. It is based on a Google Alerts RSS feed, built every ~6 hours with Jekyll and GitHub Actions.

Monthly commentary will be included on that site in the future. Immediate next steps are to add in more news aggregators as sources, to try and get articles that are missed. I would like to integrate Google Scholar as well, but it does not appear they offer an RSS feed or any simple method. Article display filtering is currently done on a keyword basis, which has been working fine, but would like to move to a classifier model.

In the next few months, ideally will introduce automated tagging and some basic client-side filtering, as well as moving older daily updates to a separate page. May add in a food access and food banks/pantries daily updates page on there as well, which would be helpful for me to stay up-to-date.
