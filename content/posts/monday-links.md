\- Whenever I do analyses I am nervous about being wrong, but using Excel's [autofill function to impute data](https://retractionwatch.com/2024/02/05/no-data-no-problem-undisclosed-tinkering-in-excel-behind-economics-paper/) would have definitely been on my "this is not correct to do," at the very least.

\- Nice [example of a personal project](https://mewo2.com/notes/terrain/). Contained, clear output, and interesting to the person doing it + delightful to play with and generate maps as a person who has no use for it. It's fun!

\- Helpful and clear description of how XSS ([cross site scripting](https://journal.hexmos.com/domxss/)) vulnerabilities work and can be identified.

\- A [nice reinforcement essay](https://cse.buffalo.edu/~rapaport/howtostudy.html#finalwords) on how to study. I like these types of pieces - especially with the great comic selection - which give very practical advice, and are quick reads. They may not have any unique advice that you wouldn't arrive to by yourself, but I imagine that by reading many of these, they reinforce the concepts in your mind over and over, hopefully making it easier for your to implement such advice.

\-Startling [examples of](https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/crime/swatting-nikki-haley-trump-fbi-stalkers-b2494097.html) ["swatting" and](https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/crime/swatting-nikki-haley-trump-fbi-stalkers-b2494097.html) how easy it is for online users to "swat" other people. Astounding that police departments don't have more protections in place to ensure danger exists prior to creating dangerous situations. It appears they institute some "do not swat" lists, but for first time offenses, these are not helpful. Would be nice to read more about the people that answer these calls, and the decision-makers that choose whether to believe the tip or not. How do they evaluate trustworthiness, or do they always consider the potential chance of saving lives to outweigh that they may be wrong?
