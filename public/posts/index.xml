      <description>&lt;p&gt;Close to 2 years ago, I had an idea for a mobile application that allowed users to store, submit, and manage tax reimbursements in foreign countries. For 2 years ago, I on and off worked on this idea and had a functioning version on my phone - and for nearly all that time, I never felt like the application was ready to release to potential users - and it doesn&amp;rsquo;t look like I&amp;rsquo;ll ever get it there.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Questions on “How Congress Can Fix Food Stamps”</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.nationalreview.com/&#34;&gt;National Review&lt;/a&gt; in July published a short opinion piece in July ‘24 entitled &lt;a href=&#34;https://archive.ph/RcWdh&#34;&gt;How Congress Can Fix Food Stamps&lt;/a&gt;. Sam Adolphsen, the author, argues that the cost of SNAP benefits is too high. He comments that &amp;ldquo;about 17.6 million food-stamp recipients are able-bodied adults, and about two-thirds don&amp;rsquo;t work,&amp;rdquo; which leads him to list a series of Republican-led, state-level policies that require SNAP recipients to participate in job training or employment programs. These policy decisions, Adolphsen argues throughout the article, are &amp;ldquo;common-sense&amp;rdquo;, &amp;ldquo;wildly popular among voters&amp;rdquo;, &amp;ldquo;turning a handout into the hand up that [SNAP benefits were] always supposed to be,&amp;rdquo; and are &amp;ldquo;protecting taxpayers while promoting work over welfare&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I re-deployed &lt;a href=&#34;https://leppekja.github.io/8redsquares/&#34;&gt;8 Red Squares&lt;/a&gt;, a site that allows you to play through the &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eight_queens_puzzle&#34;&gt;8 Queens Puzzle&lt;/a&gt; on different sized boards.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img loading=&#34;lazy&#34; src=&#34;https://laggingindicators.blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/image-5.png?w=644&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Future enhancements I&amp;rsquo;d like to add are&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Timer (for each segment), and total running time until the users solves n=8.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Better mobile support (board size 9 and 10 don&amp;rsquo;t handle small screens well).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Foundational solutions checklist, e.g., if a user wants to find all possible arrangements (excluding symmetries and rotations).&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>From a Mouse to a Trackball</title>
      <link>http://localhost:1313/posts/from-a-mouse-to-a-trackball/</link>
      <pubDate>Sat, 14 Sep 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      <guid>http://localhost:1313/posts/from-a-mouse-to-a-trackball/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;I recently bought the Kensington Slimblade Trackball to replace the Logitech MX Master mouse that I have been using for the last year. This is the first time that I&amp;rsquo;ve used a trackball. A couple of thoughts worth noting that are either omitted from or in conflict with other reviews:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The device is too large for me. It takes up almost an entire mousepad, and it is wide enough to force frequent movement between the trackball and the keyboard (I use a Glove80). I blame this partially on the desk, as it requires a roll-out keyboard holder that was not made to accommodate the split keyboard and the trackball. But for a trackball with &amp;ldquo;Slim&amp;rdquo; in the name, I expected it to be smaller.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Lessons learned on dashboard design for early-stage apps</title>
      <link>http://localhost:1313/posts/lessons-learned-on-dashboard-design-for-early-stage-apps/</link>

      <guid>http://localhost:1313/posts/lessons-learned-on-dashboard-design-for-early-stage-apps/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;What follows are a few takeaways from a recent app launch, where I had some successes and some things I had to fix. I also maintain dashboards for a wide set of clients on a different project that will be overhauled soon, and would like to apply these learnings during the redesign.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The three guiding business questions for initial design are:&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How are we getting users?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What our users are finding value in when using the application?&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Daily SNAP News Aggregator launched</title>
      <link>http://localhost:1313/posts/daily-snap-news-aggregator-launched/</link>
      <pubDate>Tue, 11 Jun 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      <guid>http://localhost:1313/posts/daily-snap-news-aggregator-launched/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Site is &lt;a href=&#34;https://leppekja.github.io/snap_news/&#34;&gt;accessible here&lt;/a&gt;, and the accompanying GitHub repository can be accessed through that site as well. It is based on a Google Alerts RSS feed, built every ~6 hours with Jekyll and GitHub Actions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Monthly commentary will be included on that site in the future. Immediate next steps are to add in more news aggregators as sources, to try and get articles that are missed. I would like to integrate Google Scholar as well, but it does not appear they offer an RSS feed or any simple method. Article display filtering is currently done on a keyword basis, which has been working fine, but would like to move to a classifier model.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>April SNAP Updates</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Note a slightly different format to topic, rather than state-based.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;snap-interview-waivers-in-some-places-expiring&#34;&gt;Snap Interview Waivers in some places expiring&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.mdhs.ms.gov/post/expiration-of-waiver-of-interview-requirements-for-snap-benefits-in-mississippi/&#34;&gt;Expiration of Waiver of Interview Requirements for SNAP Benefits in Mississippi&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://news.yahoo.com/beltrami-county-snap-interview-waiver-023600199.html&#34;&gt;Beltrami County SNAP interview waiver ends April 30&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I would be very curious to see any study performed exploring differences in program administration and case outcomes between while the waiver was in effect, and the before / after where the waiver is not in place. How has the speed of applications changed? Overpayment or underpayment rates? What do the caseworkers think about this change? I also came across &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.reddit.com/r/foodstamps/comments/198kzdi/petitioning_for_the_end_of_snap_interview/?rdt=33738&#34;&gt;this Reddit thread on the impact of interview waivers&lt;/a&gt;, but would like to see a structured case study.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Joint &amp;amp; conditional probabilities with pd.crosstab</title>
      <link>http://localhost:1313/posts/joint-conditional-probabilities-with-pd-crosstab/</link>

      <guid>http://localhost:1313/posts/joint-conditional-probabilities-with-pd-crosstab/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;pd.crosstab&lt;/code&gt; is one of those built-in functions in the Pandas API that I forget about routinely. I instinctively reached for &lt;code&gt;df.groupby(&#39;x&#39;)[&#39;y&#39;].count().unstack()&lt;/code&gt;, but when I wanted to normalize the values, it takes &lt;a href=&#34;https://stackoverflow.com/questions/37818063/how-to-calculate-conditional-probability-of-values-in-dataframe-pandas-python&#34;&gt;more and more steps&lt;/a&gt; to get where I wanted.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://lisds.github.io/textbook/useful-pandas/crosstab.html&#34;&gt;This was a nice straightforward overview&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;code&gt;pd.crosstab&lt;/code&gt; function. To document for myself, below, create a sample correlated &lt;code&gt;DataFrame&lt;/code&gt; with integer columns &lt;code&gt;ActiveUsers&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;CompletedProfile&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Identifying outbound IP addresses of a Azure Function</title>
      <link>http://localhost:1313/posts/identifying-outbound-ip-addresses-of-a-azure-function/</link>
      <pubDate>Wed, 01 May 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      <guid>http://localhost:1313/posts/identifying-outbound-ip-addresses-of-a-azure-function/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Here is &lt;a href=&#34;https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-functions/ip-addresses?tabs=portal&#34;&gt;Microsoft&amp;rsquo;s documentation page on the topic&lt;/a&gt;. The only reason I am documenting this is because the Azure Resource Explorer failed to load consistently across devices for me. Some tutorials I found, like &lt;a href=&#34;https://rubberduckdev.com/app-outbound-ip/&#34;&gt;this one&lt;/a&gt;, seem to be outdated and the outbound IP addresses weren&amp;rsquo;t listed in any Properties menu in the Function App in the Azure Portal. The Azure CLI method was what worked for me:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;az functionapp show --resource-group &amp;lt;GROUP_NAME&amp;gt; --name &amp;lt;APP_NAME&amp;gt; --query outboundIpAddresses --output tsv
az functionapp show --resource-group &amp;lt;GROUP_NAME&amp;gt; --name &amp;lt;APP_NAME&amp;gt; --query possibleOutboundIpAddresses --output tsv
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;p&gt;I wanted this as I was hoping to whitelist the IP addresses in the database firewall to allow for scheduling some SQL scripts to run daily. The issue with this is the following, copied from the above linked Microsoft documentation: &amp;ldquo;because of autoscaling behaviors, the outbound IP can change at any time when running on a &lt;a href=&#34;https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-functions/consumption-plan&#34;&gt;Consumption plan&lt;/a&gt; or in a &lt;a href=&#34;https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-functions/functions-premium-plan&#34;&gt;Premium plan&lt;/a&gt;.&amp;rdquo; While at least a few people say &lt;a href=&#34;https://stackoverflow.com/questions/49109310/how-to-allow-azure-function-to-access-database-hosted-on-azure-vm&#34;&gt;whitelist these IPs anyway&lt;/a&gt;, the recommended course of action is to set up a virtual network within Azure.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;a) improve communication skills by forcing myself to formalize an opinion. Feedback from anonymous readers may either point out an error I made while translating what I think to a written document or a flaw in the argument itself. Of course, I need to be willing to be wrong, and reminding myself that I am excited about learning is an powerful way to cope with finding errors in my work. Writing online is a low-barrier opportunity to become comfortable with this.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Replacing a mouse with a pen and tablet?</title>
      <link>http://localhost:1313/posts/replacing-a-mouse-with-a-pen-and-tablet/</link>
      <pubDate>Mon, 22 Apr 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      <guid>http://localhost:1313/posts/replacing-a-mouse-with-a-pen-and-tablet/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;These are some thoughts about using a &lt;a href=&#34;https://estore.wacom.com/en-us/wacom-intuos-s-bluetooth-black-us-ctl4100wlk0.html&#34;&gt;Wacom Intuos Wireless Pen and Tablet&lt;/a&gt; to complement a mouse and keyboard over the past few weeks. I made this purchase in an effort to decrease forearm and finger pain from overuse working at a desk. Previously, I&amp;rsquo;ve been using the Logitech MX Master 3 For Business mouse, and I was hoping that switching to a pen and tablet would limit some of the forearm rotation that was causing me pain. While I put the mouse to the side, I am still using a Glove80 keyboard, as well as Windows Voice Access.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>My UChicago MSCAPP Application Essay Answers (2018)</title>
      <link>http://localhost:1313/posts/my-uchicago-mscapp-application-essay-answers-2018/</link>
      <pubDate>Wed, 17 Apr 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      <guid>http://localhost:1313/posts/my-uchicago-mscapp-application-essay-answers-2018/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;These were my answers to the application essay questions for &lt;a href=&#34;https://capp.uchicago.edu/&#34;&gt;UChicago&amp;rsquo;s MSCAPP program&lt;/a&gt; back from the 2018 round. Only piece of advice - make sure you know what skills or knowledge you want to get out of any MS program - which means work for a bit prior to attending.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Why is a combined program between policy and computer science a good match for your career goals? (max 300 words)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With a M.S. in Computational Analysis and Public Policy, I can support the shift from Michigan nonprofits solely serving constituents to leading communities. My primary career goal is to increase volunteerism through developing the technical expertise of the nonprofit sector. By applying data science techniques, I will provide organizations with evidence of successful interventions and expand their capacity to deliver services. To accomplish this, I need intensive direction to develop my quantitative analysis skills through computer science and statistics courses.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Questions on &#34;Why We Should Rethink the SNAP Interview Requirement: A Former Caseworker’s Perspective&#34;</title>

      <description>&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Context&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Student and supporting organizations wrote a &lt;a href=&#34;https://defendstudents.org/news/body/Student-Defense-Congressional-letter-on-SNAP-petition-FINAL.pdf&#34;&gt;letter to the USDA recommending that the SNAP application interview requirement be removed&lt;/a&gt;, with &lt;a href=&#34;https://defendstudents.org/news/student-advocacy-coalition-continues-push-for-u-s-department-of-agriculture-to-remove-barriers-to-snap-benefits&#34;&gt;the accompanying press release here&lt;/a&gt;. A news article that summarizes the entire P.R. push for this is &lt;a href=&#34;https://fortune.com/2024/01/16/food-stamps-snap-interview-obstacle/&#34;&gt;accessible here through Fortune magazine&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.clasp.org/blog/why-we-should-rethink-the-snap-interview-requirement-a-former-caseworkers-perspective/&#34;&gt;Why We Should Rethink the SNAP Interview Requirement: A Former Caseworker’s Perspective&lt;/a&gt; is an op-ed from The Center for Law and Social Policy (CLASP) which argues SNAP interviews should be made optional. Based on the author&amp;rsquo;s experience as a caseworker, the mandatory interviews are largely a pretense for detecting fraud, and the time could be better spent providing holistic assistance to SNAP participants. These &amp;ldquo;unnecessary interviews that are ineffective at finding what infinitesimal fraud exists&amp;rdquo; only serve to increase the stigma associated with accessing food stamps by treating applicants as if they &amp;ldquo;are thieves that must be watched&amp;rdquo;.&lt;a href=&#34;#9e749f2e-5a57-454a-a61c-2fdc32647381&#34;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>The Cartoon Guide to Statistics</title>

&lt;p&gt;Deriving, and learning when to apply, statistical formulas is always going to be difficult. It turns out that including cartoons does not make it any easier.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I would put statistics writing into three general categories: teaching statistical literacy, e.g., How To Lie With Statistics; deriving the principles of statistical concepts, e.g., any college-level textbook; and applying statistical methods, e.g., an academic study. The Cartoon Guide To Statistics tries to do a bit of all three of these, and is worse off for it. The guide covers probability, random variables, sampling, confidence intervals, hypothesis testing, experimental design, and regression in just over 200 pages.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>How To Lie With Statistics</title>
      <link>http://localhost:1313/posts/how-to-lie-with-statistics/</link>

      <guid>http://localhost:1313/posts/how-to-lie-with-statistics/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Written by Darrell Huff and illustrated by Irving Geis. Originally published in 1954.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;In a sentence&lt;/strong&gt;: a quick, worthwhile general knowledge read that explains how people misuse statistics through familiar and useful examples (that could use an update).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img loading=&#34;lazy&#34; src=&#34;https://laggingindicators.blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/20240303_185748.jpg?w=166&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’ll face up to the serious purpose that I like to think lurks just beneath the surface of this book: explaining how to look a phony statistic in the eye and face it down; and no less important, how to recognize sound and usable data in that wilderness of fraud…&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>SNAP Benefits News - Feb 2024</title>
      <link>http://localhost:1313/posts/snap-benefits-news-feb-2024/</link>
      <pubDate>Sat, 02 Mar 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      <guid>http://localhost:1313/posts/snap-benefits-news-feb-2024/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;The following is a curated list of news articles by U.S. state and nationally that discussed SNAP benefits in February 2024.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;national&#34;&gt;National&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.fns.usda.gov/snap/governor-letter-performance-operations&#34;&gt;Letter from Secretary Vilsack to Governors on SNAP Performance and Operations&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Poor performance on the SNAP efficiency measures meant 44 states got letters from the USDA expecting improvements.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.thefencepost.com/news/congressional-leaders-agree-on-ag-funding-as-vilsack-talks-about-snap-pilot/&#34;&gt;Congressional leaders agree on ag funding as Vilsack talks about SNAP pilot&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The SNAP pilot they discuss is the &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.politico.com/live-updates/2024/02/16/congress/nearing-nutrition-funding-deal-spending-talks-00141962&#34;&gt;SNAP-choice pilot&lt;/a&gt;, limiting purchasable foods to “nutrient-dense” foods. Unsurprising that a paternalistic policy with the name “SNAP-choice” is being pushed by a Republican. See the next article for the industry’s response.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Viva Insights - How are you feeling?</title>
      <link>http://localhost:1313/posts/viva-insights-how-are-you-feeling/</link>
      <pubDate>Sat, 02 Mar 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      <guid>http://localhost:1313/posts/viva-insights-how-are-you-feeling/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Microsoft Teams provides an integration with Microsoft Viva, which schedules daily check-ins to record your perception of your mental state. Once a day, at 4pm, I get a notification that asks me to select one of five emojis that reflects how I feel.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img loading=&#34;lazy&#34; src=&#34;https://laggingindicators.blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/image-12.png?w=936&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Clearly, the last few weeks have not been particularly excellent, but I&amp;rsquo;m not sure what the value of this type of check-in or chart provides. We can come up with reasonable estimates of our own satisfaction with our work. I frequently journal, and I believe that the self-reflection forced through written inquiries gives way to a better sense of being, rather than an even shorter point-in-time indicator with almost no ambiguity.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I recently went on a weekend trip, where I counted each time that I interacted with a person who was a citizen of the country I was visiting. I did not include any interactions with individuals at the airport prior to landing at the destination, nor once I reached the airport to return. Non-verbal interactions were not considered, e.g., making room for someone on the sidewalk, or gesturing for a car to go first at an intersection.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <guid>http://localhost:1313/posts/snap-state-performance-indicators-datasets/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;I started to post &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.fns.usda.gov/snap/efficiency-effectiveness-measures&#34;&gt;SNAP performance indicators&lt;/a&gt; from the USDA in machine-readable format, aggregating and cleaning the data from the many PDF tables. &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/leppekja/SNAP-performance-indicators&#34;&gt;This repository&lt;/a&gt; includes quick-access to cleaned, FIPS-linked CSV long-format tables of yearly state reported indicators for &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.fns.usda.gov/snap/qc/timeliness&#34;&gt;Application Processing Timeliness&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.fns.usda.gov/snap/qc/per&#34;&gt;Program Error Rates&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.fns.usda.gov/snap/qc/caper&#34;&gt;Case and Procedural Error Rates&lt;/a&gt; (coming soon).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;USDA Descriptions as follows:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Application Processing Timeliness &amp;ldquo;measures the timeliness of states’ processing of initial SNAP applications. The Food and Nutrition Act of 2008 entitles all eligible households to SNAP benefits within 30 days of application, or within 7 days, if they are eligible for expedited service.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <guid>http://localhost:1313/posts/thoughts-on-babbel-live-classes/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;I took about 70 classes over a one-year unlimited class subscription with &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.babbel.com/live&#34;&gt;Babbel Live&lt;/a&gt; for Spanish from mid-2022 to 2023. My level was beginner to low intermediate over the course of the year, and I only took classes in the A1, A2, and B1 range. Prior to the classes, I was working with &lt;a href=&#34;https://apps.ankiweb.net/&#34;&gt;Anki flashcards&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.duolingo.com/&#34;&gt;Duolingo&lt;/a&gt; lessons. What follows are some thoughts I had wrote down while taking the courses. &lt;strong&gt;Some aspects of the course may have changed since I took them.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Using Observable Framework on Windows WSL and quickly deploying to GitHub Pages</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;If you&amp;rsquo;ve got &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/observablehq/framework&#34;&gt;the framework&lt;/a&gt; installed, and just want to deploy the static pages, &lt;a href=&#34;#deploying&#34;&gt;skip to below&lt;/a&gt;. Note - my first time doing this, but it works. You can always deploy directly to Observable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Observable Framework is &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/observablehq/framework/issues/90&#34;&gt;not supported on Windows&lt;/a&gt;, according to an issue in their GitHub. (Update Mar 2024: Observable Framework is now supported on Windows). To use it, you need to use WSL.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you want to use it through WSL, then the following still applies. Fortunately, it is very easy to do. Steps I had to take to do this:&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;The choices to make origami sunflowers are few. I adapted the simple &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.origami-instructions.com/origami-lotus-blossom.html&#34;&gt;Lotus Blossom&lt;/a&gt; design from Origami-Instructions.com with an additional small square of brown paper, allowing for a very simple sunflower design that holds up against other designs that have more complicated multi-sheet folding, are hexagon-based, or require glue.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;instructions&#34;&gt;Instructions&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With the Blintz base, place a sheet of brown paper within the corner folds into the center.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Glove80 Keyboard Review (3 months)</title>
      <link>http://localhost:1313/posts/gove80-keyboard-review-3-months/</link>
      <pubDate>Wed, 14 Feb 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      <guid>http://localhost:1313/posts/gove80-keyboard-review-3-months/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Some people are very into keyboards. They build them, they buy many of them, they review them. They know a lot about the software and hardware, and can describe the pros and cons of each component. When they look for a keyboard, they can use their prior experience to decide what features they care about, and can identify potential issues.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am not one of these people. But given recent wrist and forearm pain, I decided to switch impulsively to a split keyboard. I did some not-comprehensive-at-all research - I didn&amp;rsquo;t really know what I was looking at, or how to compare different brands, or what attributes to consider that would be right for me. I ended up buying the &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.moergo.com/&#34;&gt;MoErgo Glove80 Split Wireless Keyboard&lt;/a&gt;, largely because the curved design, tenting system, and my perception of the company as a start-up that had a large passionate community behind the product. It also looked reasonably professional, minimal, and like it would fit on my desk.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;- Nice &lt;a href=&#34;https://mewo2.com/notes/terrain/&#34;&gt;example of a personal project&lt;/a&gt;. Contained, clear output, and interesting to the person doing it + delightful to play with and generate maps as a person who has no use for it. It&amp;rsquo;s fun!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;- Helpful and clear description of how XSS (&lt;a href=&#34;https://journal.hexmos.com/domxss/&#34;&gt;cross site scripting&lt;/a&gt;) vulnerabilities work and can be identified.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;227 vehicles have passed by us in the last hour. We are parked on the side of the road, in a car that is leaking oil. At least the hood has stopped smoking. Our two friends left in a taxi to Taluca, the closest town, to see a mechanic and have a grua tow us either to the town, or back all the way to Mexico City.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We had gone to the park to see the monarch butterflies before they begin their migration north; we arrived too late, the mariposas had left three days prior, but the trail was still open at a discount, and many bodies of the  butterflies that died were still littered on the edges of the walking paths, the ticket takers told us. We had driven about 2 hours out of the city to see them; we were three days and two hours too late.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>There&#39;s a stone in my lentils</title>

      <guid>http://localhost:1313/posts/theres-a-stone-in-my-lentils/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;For the first time, in my many years of eating lentils, I found a small stone in my lentils while I was eating the curry. It was slightly smaller than a single lentil.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the bag of the lentils, and in every online recipe describing how to cook lentils, the following warning exists: be sure to rinse your lentils prior to cooking to remove any rocks or debris as modern cleaning equipment cannot. And I do. But I have never actually found a pebble, and so thought this was a cautionary warning that lawyers required. Now, I figured, the process of cleaning the lentils during production likely was efficient and accurate enough now (in the direct contradiction to what the warning tells me). A good self-reflection example of how my prior experience incorrectly outweighs expert knowledge.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;- A series of YouTube videos on how &amp;ldquo;practical effects&amp;rdquo; in movies are highlighted by directors, actors, and viewers, but actually are building blocks to extremely realistic computer generated visual effects. I didn&amp;rsquo;t even realize much of what he showed was technically possible: it makes sense that performing a stunt in real life can give VFX artists valuable information about how it should look when it is computer generated, but the fact that oftentimes the stunt itself is replaced with CGI is astounding; see, for instance, the Top Gun: Maverick replacement jets.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;In the past six months I&amp;rsquo;ve started to have finger, wrist, and forearm pain. I previously was using the Logitech Mx Mouse and keyboard for business. But due to the pronation of my wrists I wasn&amp;rsquo;t able to type at all without experience severe pain that would continue through the evening. so recently I&amp;rsquo;ve been using the Windows voice axis. To try and perform as much typing and as many actions on the computer as I can. This post Is entirely written using my voice. And as you can I sit I&amp;rsquo;m still having trouble making this a usable tool.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
