  <div class="post-content"><p>These were my answers to the application essay questions for <a href="https://capp.uchicago.edu/">UChicago&rsquo;s MSCAPP program</a> back from the 2018 round. Only piece of advice - make sure you know what skills or knowledge you want to get out of any MS program - which means work for a bit prior to attending.</p>

<p><em>Why is a combined program between policy and computer science a good match for your career goals? (max 300 words)</em></p>
<p>With a M.S. in Computational Analysis and Public Policy, I can support the shift from Michigan nonprofits solely serving constituents to leading communities. My primary career goal is to increase volunteerism through developing the technical expertise of the nonprofit sector. By applying data science techniques, I will provide organizations with evidence of successful interventions and expand their capacity to deliver services. To accomplish this, I need intensive direction to develop my quantitative analysis skills through computer science and statistics courses.</p>
<p>A combined program in computer science and policy is the perfect opportunity to better understand how nonprofits should capitalize on recent advances in computer science. In my eight years of working, interning, and volunteering with small and large organizations, I repeatedly find that nonprofit staff do not have the technical expertise needed to lead communities. Each has trouble implementing new technologies, as tools need to be grounded within a framework of social impact and equity. Yet this perspective is largely absent from software design. Unlike other programs, the MS-CAPP provides the computer science methods oriented toward the nonprofit and social impact industries. This degree will teach me to build tools with nonprofits rather than for them.</p>
<p>Rather than attend a master’s program that simply reinforces my strengths, the MS-CAPP is an intellectual challenge that provides me with tools to expand my limited experience with computer science and statistical analysis. Building on my economics experience and online courses on Python, linear algebra, and data science, I am ready for instruction on more advanced techniques and their applications. Overall, while my background will necessitate a disciplined approach to higher-level courses, my unique perspective will teach me to effectively communicate complex concepts to nonprofit professionals and mitigate the severe technical skills gap of the nonprofit sector.</p>
<hr>
<p><em>Describe briefly the biggest challenge you have ever faced. How did you tackle it and what did you learn? (max 300 words)</em></p>
<p>I learned what self-reliance is when I didn’t have enough money to continue my undergraduate education. It was winter break of my sophomore year. My FAFSA had been filed and I was staring at thousands of dollars of loans and an expected family contribution that I couldn’t afford.</p>
<p>The next semester, I spent my spare time completing scholarship applications. With each essay I wrestled with self-doubt, probing at why I thought I deserved their money. I still have fourteen drafts of personal statements, each boasting small accomplishments, each saying the same thing: please, I need this. Each day I looked at my resume, detailing the major – well, minor – accomplishments of my life: milestones reached, tasks completed, hours volunteered, and awards won. I saw the gaps when I compared it to others. I wondered why anyone would invest in me. Yet I kept working, turning in applications late at night after I had finished studying.</p>
<p>Being challenged to pay for my undergraduate education taught me two lessons: one, self-reliance doesn’t exist. Over the following two years, I received enough support avoid any other loans. It’s a debt that I am repaying with my career by affording opportunities for others. Two, no one is investing in me. They are investing through me, into our community.</p>
<p>As nonprofit professionals, our role is to minimize ourselves and work for others. To silence the voices in the back of our heads that doubt our strengths and indulge our weaknesses. The voice that wraps itself in layers of pride and power until it reifies itself as me. Part of me still wants to believe that my hard work earned what I have. Yet this experience reminds me that whatever I am, if anything, isn’t worth as much as what’s around me.</p>
<hr>
<p><em>Where do you see yourself getting involved in the community during your time at Harris&ndash;either at the University of Chicago or in the city of Chicago? [Optional, max 300 words]</em></p>
<p>As a community discussion group organizer, frequent volunteer, and former AmeriCorps VISTA member, I know the significance of community engagement. While studying at the University of Chicago, I will supplement my education by forming practical connections with community members through volunteerism, discussion, and supporting national service.</p>
<p>As I have not lived in Chicago, my community involvement must be carefully considered. There is an essential distinction between volunteering at a community, rather than with them. In my first year of studies, I will focus on learning more about community issues, contributing through existing student volunteering organizations, and by joining the Community Action Bureau. Additionally, volunteering with the Center for Data Science and Public Policy will complement my studies while also contributing to the wider community.</p>
<p>As a founder of a community philosophy discussion group, I will continue promoting philosophy as a tool for everyone through joining discussion groups, supporting public deliberation opportunities, and sharing resources from my Grassroots Philosophy initiative. Working with UC3P is also an excellent opportunity to further conversation on important issues. While not directly related to my studies, I will support AmeriCorps members within the city of Chicago. I know the difficulties of serving a community with low pay and minimal support. Providing any type of aid, either through events, networks, discussion, or resources is a valuable use of my time.</p>
<p>Lastly, I will join student organizations such as the Behavioral Economics and Public Policy group, Harris Consulting Club, Harris Talks, and the Harris Policy Analysis and Debate group to strengthen my grasp of related concepts and my communication skills. Through volunteering, discussion, and service support, I will contribute to the social fabric of the city and promote social learning activities.</p>
