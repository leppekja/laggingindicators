      <description>&lt;p&gt;These are some thoughts about using a &lt;a href=&#34;https://estore.wacom.com/en-us/wacom-intuos-s-bluetooth-black-us-ctl4100wlk0.html&#34;&gt;Wacom Intuos Wireless Pen and Tablet&lt;/a&gt; to complement a mouse and keyboard over the past few weeks. I made this purchase in an effort to decrease forearm and finger pain from overuse working at a desk. Previously, I&amp;rsquo;ve been using the Logitech MX Master 3 For Business mouse, and I was hoping that switching to a pen and tablet would limit some of the forearm rotation that was causing me pain. While I put the mouse to the side, I am still using a Glove80 keyboard, as well as Windows Voice Access.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
