      <description>&lt;p&gt;Some people are very into keyboards. They build them, they buy many of them, they review them. They know a lot about the software and hardware, and can describe the pros and cons of each component. When they look for a keyboard, they can use their prior experience to decide what features they care about, and can identify potential issues.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am not one of these people. But given recent wrist and forearm pain, I decided to switch impulsively to a split keyboard. I did some not-comprehensive-at-all research - I didn&amp;rsquo;t really know what I was looking at, or how to compare different brands, or what attributes to consider that would be right for me. I ended up buying the &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.moergo.com/&#34;&gt;MoErgo Glove80 Split Wireless Keyboard&lt;/a&gt;, largely because the curved design, tenting system, and my perception of the company as a start-up that had a large passionate community behind the product. It also looked reasonably professional, minimal, and like it would fit on my desk.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
