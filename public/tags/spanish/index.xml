      <description>&lt;p&gt;I took about 70 classes over a one-year unlimited class subscription with &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.babbel.com/live&#34;&gt;Babbel Live&lt;/a&gt; for Spanish from mid-2022 to 2023. My level was beginner to low intermediate over the course of the year, and I only took classes in the A1, A2, and B1 range. Prior to the classes, I was working with &lt;a href=&#34;https://apps.ankiweb.net/&#34;&gt;Anki flashcards&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.duolingo.com/&#34;&gt;Duolingo&lt;/a&gt; lessons. What follows are some thoughts I had wrote down while taking the courses. &lt;strong&gt;Some aspects of the course may have changed since I took them.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>
