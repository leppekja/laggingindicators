      <description>&lt;p&gt;These were my answers to the application essay questions for &lt;a href=&#34;https://capp.uchicago.edu/&#34;&gt;UChicago&amp;rsquo;s MSCAPP program&lt;/a&gt; back from the 2018 round. Only piece of advice - make sure you know what skills or knowledge you want to get out of any MS program - which means work for a bit prior to attending.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Why is a combined program between policy and computer science a good match for your career goals? (max 300 words)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With a M.S. in Computational Analysis and Public Policy, I can support the shift from Michigan nonprofits solely serving constituents to leading communities. My primary career goal is to increase volunteerism through developing the technical expertise of the nonprofit sector. By applying data science techniques, I will provide organizations with evidence of successful interventions and expand their capacity to deliver services. To accomplish this, I need intensive direction to develop my quantitative analysis skills through computer science and statistics courses.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
