      <description>&lt;p&gt;Close to 2 years ago, I had an idea for a mobile application that allowed users to store, submit, and manage tax reimbursements in foreign countries. For 2 years ago, I on and off worked on this idea and had a functioning version on my phone - and for nearly all that time, I never felt like the application was ready to release to potential users - and it doesn&amp;rsquo;t look like I&amp;rsquo;ll ever get it there.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>From a Mouse to a Trackball</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I recently bought the Kensington Slimblade Trackball to replace the Logitech MX Master mouse that I have been using for the last year. This is the first time that I&amp;rsquo;ve used a trackball. A couple of thoughts worth noting that are either omitted from or in conflict with other reviews:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The device is too large for me. It takes up almost an entire mousepad, and it is wide enough to force frequent movement between the trackball and the keyboard (I use a Glove80). I blame this partially on the desk, as it requires a roll-out keyboard holder that was not made to accommodate the split keyboard and the trackball. But for a trackball with &amp;ldquo;Slim&amp;rdquo; in the name, I expected it to be smaller.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Replacing a mouse with a pen and tablet?</title>
      <link>http://localhost:1313/posts/replacing-a-mouse-with-a-pen-and-tablet/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;These are some thoughts about using a &lt;a href=&#34;https://estore.wacom.com/en-us/wacom-intuos-s-bluetooth-black-us-ctl4100wlk0.html&#34;&gt;Wacom Intuos Wireless Pen and Tablet&lt;/a&gt; to complement a mouse and keyboard over the past few weeks. I made this purchase in an effort to decrease forearm and finger pain from overuse working at a desk. Previously, I&amp;rsquo;ve been using the Logitech MX Master 3 For Business mouse, and I was hoping that switching to a pen and tablet would limit some of the forearm rotation that was causing me pain. While I put the mouse to the side, I am still using a Glove80 keyboard, as well as Windows Voice Access.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>The Cartoon Guide to Statistics</title>

&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Deriving, and learning when to apply, statistical formulas is always going to be difficult. It turns out that including cartoons does not make it any easier.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I would put statistics writing into three general categories: teaching statistical literacy, e.g., How To Lie With Statistics; deriving the principles of statistical concepts, e.g., any college-level textbook; and applying statistical methods, e.g., an academic study. The Cartoon Guide To Statistics tries to do a bit of all three of these, and is worse off for it. The guide covers probability, random variables, sampling, confidence intervals, hypothesis testing, experimental design, and regression in just over 200 pages.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Glove80 Keyboard Review (3 months)</title>
      <link>http://localhost:1313/posts/gove80-keyboard-review-3-months/</link>
      <pubDate>Wed, 14 Feb 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Some people are very into keyboards. They build them, they buy many of them, they review them. They know a lot about the software and hardware, and can describe the pros and cons of each component. When they look for a keyboard, they can use their prior experience to decide what features they care about, and can identify potential issues.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am not one of these people. But given recent wrist and forearm pain, I decided to switch impulsively to a split keyboard. I did some not-comprehensive-at-all research - I didn&amp;rsquo;t really know what I was looking at, or how to compare different brands, or what attributes to consider that would be right for me. I ended up buying the &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.moergo.com/&#34;&gt;MoErgo Glove80 Split Wireless Keyboard&lt;/a&gt;, largely because the curved design, tenting system, and my perception of the company as a start-up that had a large passionate community behind the product. It also looked reasonably professional, minimal, and like it would fit on my desk.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
