      <description>&lt;p&gt;Close to 2 years ago, I had an idea for a mobile application that allowed users to store, submit, and manage tax reimbursements in foreign countries. For 2 years ago, I on and off worked on this idea and had a functioning version on my phone - and for nearly all that time, I never felt like the application was ready to release to potential users - and it doesn&amp;rsquo;t look like I&amp;rsquo;ll ever get it there.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
