      <description>&lt;p&gt;In the past six months I&amp;rsquo;ve started to have finger, wrist, and forearm pain. I previously was using the Logitech Mx Mouse and keyboard for business. But due to the pronation of my wrists I wasn&amp;rsquo;t able to type at all without experience severe pain that would continue through the evening. so recently I&amp;rsquo;ve been using the Windows voice axis. To try and perform as much typing and as many actions on the computer as I can. This post Is entirely written using my voice. And as you can I sit I&amp;rsquo;m still having trouble making this a usable tool.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
