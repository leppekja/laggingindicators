      <title>Questions on “How Congress Can Fix Food Stamps”</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.nationalreview.com/&#34;&gt;National Review&lt;/a&gt; in July published a short opinion piece in July ‘24 entitled &lt;a href=&#34;https://archive.ph/RcWdh&#34;&gt;How Congress Can Fix Food Stamps&lt;/a&gt;. Sam Adolphsen, the author, argues that the cost of SNAP benefits is too high. He comments that &amp;ldquo;about 17.6 million food-stamp recipients are able-bodied adults, and about two-thirds don&amp;rsquo;t work,&amp;rdquo; which leads him to list a series of Republican-led, state-level policies that require SNAP recipients to participate in job training or employment programs. These policy decisions, Adolphsen argues throughout the article, are &amp;ldquo;common-sense&amp;rdquo;, &amp;ldquo;wildly popular among voters&amp;rdquo;, &amp;ldquo;turning a handout into the hand up that [SNAP benefits were] always supposed to be,&amp;rdquo; and are &amp;ldquo;protecting taxpayers while promoting work over welfare&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Daily SNAP News Aggregator launched</title>

      <guid>http://localhost:1313/posts/daily-snap-news-aggregator-launched/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Site is &lt;a href=&#34;https://leppekja.github.io/snap_news/&#34;&gt;accessible here&lt;/a&gt;, and the accompanying GitHub repository can be accessed through that site as well. It is based on a Google Alerts RSS feed, built every ~6 hours with Jekyll and GitHub Actions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Monthly commentary will be included on that site in the future. Immediate next steps are to add in more news aggregators as sources, to try and get articles that are missed. I would like to integrate Google Scholar as well, but it does not appear they offer an RSS feed or any simple method. Article display filtering is currently done on a keyword basis, which has been working fine, but would like to move to a classifier model.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>April SNAP Updates</title>
      <link>http://localhost:1313/posts/april-snap-updates/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Note a slightly different format to topic, rather than state-based.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;snap-interview-waivers-in-some-places-expiring&#34;&gt;Snap Interview Waivers in some places expiring&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.mdhs.ms.gov/post/expiration-of-waiver-of-interview-requirements-for-snap-benefits-in-mississippi/&#34;&gt;Expiration of Waiver of Interview Requirements for SNAP Benefits in Mississippi&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://news.yahoo.com/beltrami-county-snap-interview-waiver-023600199.html&#34;&gt;Beltrami County SNAP interview waiver ends April 30&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I would be very curious to see any study performed exploring differences in program administration and case outcomes between while the waiver was in effect, and the before / after where the waiver is not in place. How has the speed of applications changed? Overpayment or underpayment rates? What do the caseworkers think about this change? I also came across &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.reddit.com/r/foodstamps/comments/198kzdi/petitioning_for_the_end_of_snap_interview/?rdt=33738&#34;&gt;this Reddit thread on the impact of interview waivers&lt;/a&gt;, but would like to see a structured case study.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Context&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Student and supporting organizations wrote a &lt;a href=&#34;https://defendstudents.org/news/body/Student-Defense-Congressional-letter-on-SNAP-petition-FINAL.pdf&#34;&gt;letter to the USDA recommending that the SNAP application interview requirement be removed&lt;/a&gt;, with &lt;a href=&#34;https://defendstudents.org/news/student-advocacy-coalition-continues-push-for-u-s-department-of-agriculture-to-remove-barriers-to-snap-benefits&#34;&gt;the accompanying press release here&lt;/a&gt;. A news article that summarizes the entire P.R. push for this is &lt;a href=&#34;https://fortune.com/2024/01/16/food-stamps-snap-interview-obstacle/&#34;&gt;accessible here through Fortune magazine&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.clasp.org/blog/why-we-should-rethink-the-snap-interview-requirement-a-former-caseworkers-perspective/&#34;&gt;Why We Should Rethink the SNAP Interview Requirement: A Former Caseworker’s Perspective&lt;/a&gt; is an op-ed from The Center for Law and Social Policy (CLASP) which argues SNAP interviews should be made optional. Based on the author&amp;rsquo;s experience as a caseworker, the mandatory interviews are largely a pretense for detecting fraud, and the time could be better spent providing holistic assistance to SNAP participants. These &amp;ldquo;unnecessary interviews that are ineffective at finding what infinitesimal fraud exists&amp;rdquo; only serve to increase the stigma associated with accessing food stamps by treating applicants as if they &amp;ldquo;are thieves that must be watched&amp;rdquo;.&lt;a href=&#34;#9e749f2e-5a57-454a-a61c-2fdc32647381&#34;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>
