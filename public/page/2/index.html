    </h2>

  <div class="entry-content">
    <p>These are some thoughts about using a Wacom Intuos Wireless Pen and Tablet to complement a mouse and keyboard over the past few weeks. I made this purchase in an effort to decrease forearm and finger pain from overuse working at a desk. Previously, I’ve been using the Logitech MX Master 3 For Business mouse, and I was hoping that switching to a pen and tablet would limit some of the forearm rotation that was causing me pain. While I put the mouse to the side, I am still using a Glove80 keyboard, as well as Windows Voice Access.

    </h2>

  <div class="entry-content">
    <p>These were my answers to the application essay questions for UChicago’s MSCAPP program back from the 2018 round. Only piece of advice - make sure you know what skills or knowledge you want to get out of any MS program - which means work for a bit prior to attending.
Why is a combined program between policy and computer science a good match for your career goals? (max 300 words)
With a M.S. in Computational Analysis and Public Policy, I can support the shift from Michigan nonprofits solely serving constituents to leading communities. My primary career goal is to increase volunteerism through developing the technical expertise of the nonprofit sector. By applying data science techniques, I will provide organizations with evidence of successful interventions and expand their capacity to deliver services. To accomplish this, I need intensive direction to develop my quantitative analysis skills through computer science and statistics courses.

    </h2>
  </header>
  <div class="entry-content">
    <p> Context
Student and supporting organizations wrote a letter to the USDA recommending that the SNAP application interview requirement be removed, with the accompanying press release here. A news article that summarizes the entire P.R. push for this is accessible here through Fortune magazine.
Why We Should Rethink the SNAP Interview Requirement: A Former Caseworker’s Perspective is an op-ed from The Center for Law and Social Policy (CLASP) which argues SNAP interviews should be made optional. Based on the author’s experience as a caseworker, the mandatory interviews are largely a pretense for detecting fraud, and the time could be better spent providing holistic assistance to SNAP participants. These “unnecessary interviews that are ineffective at finding what infinitesimal fraud exists” only serve to increase the stigma associated with accessing food stamps by treating applicants as if they “are thieves that must be watched”.1

    <p>Written by Larry Gonick &amp; Woollcott Smith
Note: This is based on the “Revised and Updated Edition”.
Cover page of The Cartoon Guide to Statistics
Deriving, and learning when to apply, statistical formulas is always going to be difficult. It turns out that including cartoons does not make it any easier.
I would put statistics writing into three general categories: teaching statistical literacy, e.g., How To Lie With Statistics; deriving the principles of statistical concepts, e.g., any college-level textbook; and applying statistical methods, e.g., an academic study. The Cartoon Guide To Statistics tries to do a bit of all three of these, and is worse off for it. The guide covers probability, random variables, sampling, confidence intervals, hypothesis testing, experimental design, and regression in just over 200 pages.

In a sentence: a quick, worthwhile general knowledge read that explains how people misuse statistics through familiar and useful examples (that could use an update).
I’ll face up to the serious purpose that I like to think lurks just beneath the surface of this book: explaining how to look a phony statistic in the eye and face it down; and no less important, how to recognize sound and usable data in that wilderness of fraud…

    <p>The following is a curated list of news articles by U.S. state and nationally that discussed SNAP benefits in February 2024.
National Letter from Secretary Vilsack to Governors on SNAP Performance and Operations
Poor performance on the SNAP efficiency measures meant 44 states got letters from the USDA expecting improvements. Congressional leaders agree on ag funding as Vilsack talks about SNAP pilot
The SNAP pilot they discuss is the SNAP-choice pilot, limiting purchasable foods to “nutrient-dense” foods. Unsurprising that a paternalistic policy with the name “SNAP-choice” is being pushed by a Republican. See the next article for the industry’s response.

  <div class="entry-content">
    <p>Microsoft Teams provides an integration with Microsoft Viva, which schedules daily check-ins to record your perception of your mental state. Once a day, at 4pm, I get a notification that asks me to select one of five emojis that reflects how I feel.
Clearly, the last few weeks have not been particularly excellent, but I’m not sure what the value of this type of check-in or chart provides. We can come up with reasonable estimates of our own satisfaction with our work. I frequently journal, and I believe that the self-reflection forced through written inquiries gives way to a better sense of being, rather than an even shorter point-in-time indicator with almost no ambiguity.
